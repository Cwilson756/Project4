## Data Clean Up
   For this clean up, we used the Pandas and Regex libraries. Our data came from [The Paleobiology Database](https://paleobiodb.org/#/). Once converted from CSV to dataframe, the data was explored, and reduced from thirty-one to seven columns. Columns that were insufficient or wholly incomplete were dropped.\
   Further eccentricities found in the environment column were scrubbed using the regex library.
   
## Label Encoded vs Hot Encode
Label_Encoded technique was used over hot encoder because it had a higher acurracy, it reach 91 percent%
