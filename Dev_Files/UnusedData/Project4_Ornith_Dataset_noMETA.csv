Most of the bones lie at the bottom of this unit, whereas the fossil plants are distributed throughout the bed. This unit is underlain by beds of red, purple, and green-hued carbonate, mudstone, fine sandstone, and siltstone. The base of the fossil-bearing unit is incised into the underlying carbonate unit, or even into the oxidized, muddy siltstone beneath the carbonate unit. Bones are often incorporated within lenses of conglomerate consisting of subrounded to rounded carbonate pebbles. Kirkland and Carpenter (1994) interpreted the carbonate pebbles to be transported calcareous soil nodules, but they may be rip-up clasts from the carbonate unit that underlies the fossil bearing unit in some areas.\r\n The fossiliferous unit is overlain by a bed of resistant, fine-grained volcanic tuff which is well cemented and tends to break perpendicular to the bedding. It was from this tuff that one nearly complete articulated fish, and parts of several others, were recovered (see Kirkland, this volume).\r\nThe presence of a laterally continuous carbonate bed below the quarry, and two laterally continuous tuff units above, indicates that the tuffs were deposited in a predominantly lacustrine environment. Based on the lateral extent of the tuffs, it is estimated that the lake was at least 1.5 km wide. The occurrence of articulated fish in the lower tuff unit indicates deposition in quiet water, although the presence of ripple marks suggest that the water was relatively shallow at times. The fact that fossil root casts are present in the tuff to the southwest and east of Rabbit Valley, but absent in the area of the quarry, implies that the lake level receded temporarily, although water remained in the area of the quarry. The disconformable base of the fossiliferous unit which contains lenses of carbonate pebbles and bone, suggests evidence for temporary fluvial conditions when the unit was first being deposited.",mudstone,lithified,"silty,conglomeratic",conglomerate,lithified,calcareous,pond,,,Tithonian,-,Tithonian,"Kimmeridgian, Tithonian","Kimmeridgian, Tithonian"

The lithology is well indurated, but eroded by shoreline processes. Laterally adjacent to and just above (1.5–2.0 m) the structures are a few medium- to very thick-bedded (0.2–1.5 m) lenticular sandstones of limited lateral extent (<5 m). Some of these sandstones follow concave bedding planes, hinting at channel bedforms. Sorting in the main lithology is moderate to poor, and the framework is primarily composed of medium- to coarse-grained sand composed of varying proportions of quartz, feldspars, and lithic clasts. Angular cobbles and boulders of lithic clasts are common in the basal 2–3 m of the outcrop, decrease in size and frequency for most of the succeeding section, and are common again in the upper part of the outcrop. A discontinuous breccia bed, about 30–40 cm thick, is lateral to (east of) the three structures and stratigraphically just above one of the structures, as explained later. Low-angle cross-bedding and horizontal, planar bedding is defined in places by aligned pebbles, cobbles, and a few bedding planes, but otherwise internal stratification is difficult to define, and the overall lithology is somewhat massive. Spherical to semispherical concretions, most of which are 2–15 cm in diameter, are evident in places; fractured examples of these reveal lithic clasts as nuclei.""\r\n""The track is in a very fine-fine lithic arenite, although the track itself is filled with fine-coarse, moderately sorted quartz and lithic sand held together with hematitic cement.

The lowermost mudstone is greater than 35 cm in thickness,light greenish grey and weakly calcareous. This unit exhibits extensive dark reddish grey mottling over its uppermost portion. Additionally, carbonate nodules as much as 4.5 cm in diameter form a discontinuous layer of 20–25 cm below the sharp upper contact of the unit. A dark greenish-grey claystone succeeds vertically. This 25 cm thick unit is calcareous with a platy structure and grades upwards into a greenish grey blocky mudstone with some organics. This third unit encloses the upper portion of the sedimentary structure (figure 2a,d ) and bears a sharp, irregular contact with an overlying burrowed dark red claystone...The lithology of the structure contrasts sharply with the surrounding host mudrock and facilitates recognition of the structure in the field (figure 2). The lower, bone-bearing portion consists of 25–30 cm of medium to fine, calcareous greenish-grey sandstone, moderately sorted with abundant plagioclase and other volcanogenic grains (figure 2d ). Small (3–6 mm), rounded mud clasts are common in the coarser basal portion. This structureless unit fines upwards with an increasing clay content. A thin, 1–2 cm thick, grey claystone separates this lower sand- stone from an upper fine sandstone. The bedding parallels that of the host mudrocks. Reduced clay content, grey colour and larger (approx. 10 mm), platy mud clasts distinguish this unit from the otherwise similar, lower sandstone.

Most of the bones lie at the bottom of this unit, whereas the fossil plants are distributed throughout the bed. This unit is underlain by beds of red, purple, and green-hued carbonate, mudstone, fine sandstone, and siltstone. The base of the fossil-bearing unit is incised into the underlying carbonate unit, or even into the oxidized, muddy siltstone beneath the carbonate unit. Bones are often incorporated within lenses of conglomerate consisting of subrounded to rounded carbonate pebbles. Kirkland and Carpenter (1994) interpreted the carbonate pebbles to be transported calcareous soil nodules, but they may be rip-up clasts from the carbonate unit that underlies the fossil bearing unit in some areas.\r\n The fossiliferous unit is overlain by a bed of resistant, fine-grained volcanic tuff which is well cemented and tends to break perpendicular to the bedding. It was from this tuff that one nearly complete articulated fish, and parts of several others, were recovered (see Kirkland, this volume).\r\nThe presence of a laterally continuous carbonate bed below the quarry, and two laterally continuous tuff units above, indicates that the tuffs were deposited in a predominantly lacustrine environment. Based on the lateral extent of the tuffs, it is estimated that the lake was at least 1.5 km wide. The occurrence of articulated fish in the lower tuff unit indicates deposition in quiet water, although the presence of ripple marks suggest that the water was relatively shallow at times. The fact that fossil root casts are present in the tuff to the southwest and east of Rabbit Valley, but absent in the area of the quarry, implies that the lake level receded temporarily, although water remained in the area of the quarry. The disconformable base of the fossiliferous unit which contains lenses of carbonate pebbles and bone, suggests evidence for temporary fluvial conditions when the unit was first being deposited.",mudstone,lithified,"silty,conglomeratic",conglomerate,lithified,calcareous,pond,,,Tithonian,-,Tithonian,"Kimmeridgian, Tithonian","Kimmeridgian, Tithonian"

The uppermost St. Mary River Formation and lowermost Willow Creek Formation are both exposed along the river in this area. Due to the strongly upthrust and faulted condition of the bedrock strata in the area and the absence of obvious outcrops of the Battle Formation and Whitemud Member marker beds in the quarry area, it has been difficult to determine the precise stratigraphic position of the specimen in relation to the contact between the St. Mary River and Willow Creek formations. Nonetheless, existing geologic maps of the area suggest that the quarry occurs within the upper 30 m of the St. Mary River Formation [9]. This stratigraphic position is supported by the presence of the angiosperm palynomorph Scollardia trapaformis (D.R. Braman, personal communication) in the host matrix of TMP 2005.055.0001. S. trapaformis is diagnostic for upper beds of both the St. Mary River Formation and the combined Carbon and Whitemud members of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (southern and central Alberta) [10, 11]. Carbon Member strata north of Drumheller have yielded the chasmosaurine Eotriceratops xerinsularis [10: Figure 3] and are assigned an age of 67.5–68.5 mega-annum (Ma) [10–12]. Given that well-established chronostratigraphic correlations across southern Alberta equate the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation with the upper St. Mary River Formation (see Figure 9 in [13]), the holotype likely shares this same middle Maastrichtian age.",St. Mary River,,,,not reported,lithified,,,,,terrestrial indet.,,,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian

Most clasts in the conglomerate consist of reworked off-white punky pedogenic carbonate nodules identical to those in units 2–3, green\r\nand gray colored clay rip-ups (Fig. 4E) and fish debris (Fig. 5A) supported by a gray feldspathic-lithic sand matrix (Munsell Gley 1 6/N). Clay clasts are generally greenish gray (Munsell Gley 1 6/5GY), but some are gray (Munsell Gley 1 7/N), and range in size from 2 mm to 20 mm. The clay/carbonate clast ratio is locally highly variable but is usually subequal. Clay clast bulk composition (Table S1) shows the green ones are mixed siliceous mudstone compositionally very similar to unit 3 (chlorite-kaolinite-illite = 22%, 23%, 55%), while the gray ones are slightly higher in carbonate, classifying as argillaceous siliceous mudstone with a slightly higher illite fraction (chlorite-kaolinite-illite = 16%, 10%, 74%). Most fish scales are concentrated near the bottom of unit 4 in a lag which also hosts gastropod and bivalve steinkerns, carbonized roots, charcoal (Fig. 5C), other microvertebrates, and locally common macrovertebrate remains. Fractured tyrannosaur elements in units 4 and 5, have gray sandstone infillings identical to the matrix in which they reside. In stark contrast, pneumatic and vascular pore spaces inside structurally intact robust elements like vertebral centra, are filled with both precipitated (not clasts) off-white punky pedogenic carbonate (Fig. 6A) and green mudstone (Fig. 6B). Such mud-fills readily form early in the burial history of mud-hosted bone via hydrologic vacuums created by escaping decompositional gasses (Bodzioch, 2015) and indicate that RUQ tyrannosaur material was initially buried in greenish mudstone. Analysis of clay inside a RUQ tyrannosaur centra shows it to have the same kaolinite fraction, but slightly higher chlorite and lower illite levels than either unit 3 or the unit 4 green and gray clasts (Table S1). Seemingly, the constant kaolinite fraction and elevated chlorite and illite levels link all these clays genetically, with observed variations paralleling those in modern depositional settings with heterogeneous source areas (Griffiths et al., 2019). Regardless, the contrasting infill of intact elements demonstrates their primary depositional context was not units 4 and 5, but a pedogenic mudstone similar to unit 3. Unit 4 generally forms the base of the bone-bearing interval in lenses and sheets within the lower 30–50 cm of the bonebed, but does locally pinch out over small topographic ridges in the underlying scoured units (Fig. 5B) and at the north edge of the quarry (Fig. 7) where the whole succession onlaps underlying units and thins dramatically.""",sandstone,,,conglomerate,,sandy,coarse channel fill,,"""low velocities resulted from proximity to the channel bank, possibly in a transitional zone between active cutbank erosion and point bar deposition""",Campanian,-,Campanian,"Campanian, Maastrichtian","Campanian, Maastrichtian"

Within the BAB quarry, areas of paleosol development are preserved, reflected by the presence of rhizoliths.""",siltstone,,,sandstone,,,crevasse splay,,,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian
